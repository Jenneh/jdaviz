# jdaviz

A repository for developing astronomical data analysis tools in the Jupyter
platform. Depending on your point of view, can be "JWST Data Analysis
Visualization Tools", "Jupyter Data Analysis Visualization", or "Jupyter Data
analysis for Astronomy with glue-Viz".


# Notebook Based Cubeviz

## Install requirements

This is probably more than is required to just run in a notebook but for now, try this...

  * `conda create -n jdaviz-dev`
  * `conda activate jdaviz-dev`
  * `pip install -e .`

## Example CubeViz Notebook

There is an example CubeViz notebook in the `examples/` directory to try out.  Change the filename location to point to 
a dataset on your system.
